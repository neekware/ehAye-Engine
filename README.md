## Overview

**ehAye‚Ñ¢ Engine** (pronounced "A.I.") gives your A.I. coding assistants a voice, vision, and control. It unifies sound, sight, and system intelligence into one modular platform, powering real-time interaction across audio, music, and creative tools‚Äîwith privacy at its core.

What started as a voice engine for developers who wanted their A.I. to speak intelligently has evolved into a comprehensive modular system that brings together Audio, MCP (vision and control), Music, and Creator modules for full-spectrum A.I. expression.

## Why ehAye‚Ñ¢ Engine?

> "I built ehAye‚Ñ¢ Engine because I wanted my A.I. coding assistants to speak, not just reply on a screen, but sound alive. What began as a small developer tool quickly grew into something bigger, faster, smarter, and too good to keep private.
>
> ehAye‚Ñ¢ Engine gives your A.I. coding assistants a voice, vision, and control. It runs locally, with your privacy in mind, and is built for developers who want a coding partner, not just a tool.
>
> A tool that became a platform, and my coding partner, simply because it needed to exist."
>
> ‚Äî **Val Neekman**, Founder @ Neekware Inc.

## Key Features

### üéôÔ∏è **What is ehAye‚Ñ¢ Engine?**

ehAye‚Ñ¢ (pronounced "A.I.") started as **ehAye‚Ñ¢ Audio**, a voice engine built for developers who wanted their A.I. to speak intelligently. It has since evolved into **ehAye‚Ñ¢ Engine**, a modular system that brings together Audio, MCP (vision and control), Music, and Creator modules for full-spectrum A.I. expression.

Born from the idea that some tools simply need to exist, ehAye‚Ñ¢ Engine gives your code, agents, and creative systems a voice and presence that feels alive.

**Give your Artificial Intelligence the voice it deserves.**

### ü§ñ **A.I. Code Integration**

Connect your A.I. assistants directly to sound. ehAye‚Ñ¢ Engine integrates seamlessly with tools like:

- **Anthropic's Claude Code**
- **Gemini Code**
- **Codex**
- **Grok**
- **Cursor CLI**

Delivering real-time audio feedback, alerts, and voice interaction. Built modular for maximum compatibility, it runs entirely local for speed, privacy, and zero additional API cost.

**Audio on demand. Fully local. Zero friction.**

### üë• **Dual Voice Support**

Assign distinct voices to different agents, tasks, or events:

- One voice for your A.I. assistant working on your primary task
- Another for your secondary project
- Always know who's speaking and why

Perfect for parallel workflows, multi-agent orchestration, and real-time development feedback.

### ‚ö° **Real-Time Configuration & Privacy**

Adjust voices, tone, volume, speech rate, and behavior on the fly:

- No rebuilds, restarts, or downtime
- All processing stays private on your system
- Updates apply instantly through the web dashboard
- Keep your A.I. responsive and adaptable mid-session

**Control it live. Feel it respond. Tuck it away and keep building.**

### üîß **Easy Management**

Control everything with simple CLI commands and an intuitive web interface:

- Start, stop, and monitor the voice engine effortlessly
- Built-in process management
- Designed for developers who want zero-friction control
- Never leave your workflow

## Quick Start

ehAye‚Ñ¢ Engine is designed to integrate seamlessly with your favorite AI coding assistants. Simply install, configure your preferences through the intuitive dashboard, and let your AI speak.

## Integration Examples

ehAye‚Ñ¢ Engine works with popular AI coding tools including Claude Code, Gemini Code, Codex, Grok, and Cursor CLI. The modular architecture ensures maximum compatibility while running entirely local for speed, privacy, and zero additional API cost.

## Architecture

ehAye‚Ñ¢ Engine is built on a modular architecture:

- **Audio Module**: Real-time voice synthesis and playback
